In this study at the University of Waterloo, we tried to design a contract predictor model which basically returns relevant contract addresses to a user public key based on historical contracts the user run before. We first go through the general RecSys design we used in this study for on-chain data, then provide a more costumized extended version of such RecSys focused on personalized web3 marketing quests/airdrops."
