# Why Seshat?


**Seshat**, the First Personalized Recommendation Engine for the Web3 Era

**Why do we need a recommendation engine for Web3?**

To bring more users to the Web3 ecosystem, we need to deliver the same experience they had in Web2. However, as a dApp developer, when we add the "connect wallet" functionality to our product, we only have access to the user's public key. With just a public key and on-chain transactions, there's no way to use traditional Web2 recommendation engines. To deliver a personalized experience similar to what FANG companies offer, we need a new personalization engine that fits our new journey. Enter Seshat!

**How does Seshat work?**

In the generative AI world we live in, it's inevitable to leverage AI technology to solve the Web3 recommendation engine problem. Seshat uses its own generative AI, trained self-supervised on over 20 million contracts and more than 1 billion transactions across various blockchains (Ethereum, Aptos, Cosmos, NEAR, Solana, Axelar, and many more). This allows Seshat to understand the story behind each user interaction across all chains, making it chain-agnostic. Our data adaptors connect to any chain-scans and process real-time user transactions (i.e., user-user or user-contract interactions). This approach not only benefits on-chain asset recommendations but also covers off-chain assets to expand Web3 penetration. With machine understanding of each transaction and the generalizability of new contracts, we can bring all the personalization knowledge we have from the Web2 era.

**Why the name Seshat?**

The name Seshat was chosen in honor of the ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing. Seshat was known for her ability to bring order and structure to the universe, much like our recommendation engine aims to bring personalized experiences to the blockchain, Web3, and dApps ecosystem. The connection between the name Seshat and our technology lies in the ability to bring order, understanding, and personalization to the vast and complex world of Web3. By leveraging the wisdom of Seshat, we aim to create a seamless, personalized experience for users across the Web3 landscape.



<!-- Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.


## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.


So what are the main sections for our product documentation? 
The persona here is two main parties:
- Marketer, advertisers, anyone who wanna run targeted on-chain campaing for their marketing purpuses
- Publishers, dApp developers, blockchain deverlopers, defi protocols, any parties that deal with end user 

So based on the personas, we can have the follosing sections:
- Intro and concepts
- Web3 advertisements
- Web3 personalization
Users don't need to choose a role (just add more complexity, simple is better), they just create an accountn with nextAuth, and receive an API-Key, there are two caps:
- One for the number of calling recommender API 
- Another for a cap limit for size of the items

For ads API, the advertiser building campain is from web application, but dApp deverlopers as publishers can install the sdk, and get the ads for a specific user, and return the nessary feedback regarding the user interaction, maybe in future we need to use some 3rd party tracker to prevent fraud, or even design a cosmos-based blockchain that do the securing an on-chain ads protocol. -->
