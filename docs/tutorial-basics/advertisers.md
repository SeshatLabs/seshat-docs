# Advertisers & Marketers


To create a campaign, marketers first need to create an account on [seshatlabs.xyz](https://seshatlabs.xyz). They can either connect their blockchain wallet or use Login with Google. Next, they should go to [seshatlabs.xyz/campaign](seshatlabs.xyz/campaign) and start building their campaign. It's straightforward - just specify the campaign type (airdrop mode will be added soon), campaign title, and description. Make sure to provide as much detail as possible in the description, as it helps our Web3 recommender target the best user addresses for your ads. Take your time to explain your campaign, user persona, and any relevant information. Finally, set your budget and campaign timeline. That's it! We'll handle the personalization for you.

Additionally, you can view and manage your previous and ongoing campaigns, update settings, pause them, or even cancel and delete them.
